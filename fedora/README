To create an RPM for fedora.

If you haven't created an RPM build environment before: dnf install rpmdevtools mock && rpmdev-setuptree

This creates an rpmbuild environment in ~/rpmbuild

Copy the spec into ~/rpmbuild/SPECS (editing the versions and githash in define if required)

Then, updating to the correct versions where required:
```
cd ~/rpmbuild
spectool -R -g SPECS/gamehub.spec # Downloads the tarball from releases to the SOURCES directory
rpmbuild -bs SPECS/gamehub.spec # Create the SRPM to build from
mock SRPMS/gamehub-0.11.6-1.9.7e443e4.fc29.src.rpm
```
